        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>We were at Qdoba and became unfocused while brainstorming ideas for MadHacks. In a moment of genius, we
            decided the perfect solution would be a browser extension that allows the user to stay on focus by blocking
            sites not relevant to their topic they are working on.</p>

        <h1>What it does</h1>
        <p>Our extension allows the user to input a topic they are working on, and using advanced AI algorithms,
            processes visited webpages and determines whether the user is staying on topic or not. If the user visits an
            "off-topic" page they will be given a gentle reminder to stay on task. After a period of time, the user is
            rewarded with some free time, by popular time-management method "pomodoro timer".</p>

        <h1>How we built it</h1>
        <p>Our extension utilizes the powerful and universal Google Chrome API to retrieve relevant data from the
            websites the user visits. Our bootstrap front-end grabs text and forwards via an HTTP request to a Google
            Cloud Function which contains Python code to utilize OpenAI API to process whether the website is related
            to the user's topic. An HTTP response is sent back containing a binary identifier on whether the user is
            on/off-topic. The front-end then handles the identifier and appropriately blocks out the site so the user
            must return to the topic at hand.</p>

        <h1>Challenges we ran into</h1>
        <p>Initially, we had some trouble setting up a Chrome extension as none of us had experience with this type of
            development before. Two other issues arose later on in our development cycle. Firstly, was coding trouble
            regarding the extension persisting time data across tabs to accurately and with low performance overhead
            to the browser. Secondly, was finding an appropriate LLM model that could identify website topics accurately
            and quickly, and later waiting for OpenAI to recover from an outage.</p>

        <h1>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h1>
        <p>We are especially proud of quickly handling tab event updates and processing topics while still allowing an
            easy integration into our other systems.</p>

        <h1>What we learned</h1>
        <p>Web development can take many paths, and sometimes the easiest path is not the easiest.</p>

        <h1>What's next for TopicTunnel</h1>
        <p>Becoming a startup and bought out for 1 million dollars</p>
